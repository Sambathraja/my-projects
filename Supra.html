The legendary Mk4 Supra was propelled to fame by the immortal 2JZ engine. The Mk4 Supra's immortality is due to the legendary 2JZ engine. This engine was over-engineered to the point where it could produce over 1000 horsepower without requiring any internal modifications.</font></h1>

<h1><font face="Ink Free"> A Japanese Auto mechanic modified his Supra MK4 into something new.

That is 377.2kmph. The mechanic is none other than the legendery Kazuhiko Nagata who has gained his place among the hearts of car enthusiasts as SMOKEY NAGATA.</font></h1>

<h1><font face="Ink Free"> Some of the people still wonder what the phrase"ratatatata" stands for. It is just the imitation of the supra's exhaust. Once modified to full potential, this beast's exhaust starts spitting powerful shots of fire. Some of the shots even make you go deaf temporarily..........or permanently. It depends on how powerful the shot was. So next time careful when you're near a supra!</font></h1>
